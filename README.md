This is a project for my CSC453 Parallel Processing course. Acknowledgement: Thank you Dr. Sofien Gannouni for this opportunity.

Note: To run .cu file, you must have the following:
nvcc compiler (MSVC)
cl (CUDA kit)

This tiny piece of information took me 2 hours to learn and understand.


The structure of the project:
bitonicsort.c -> language c file with no CUDA parallelism
bitonicsort.cu -> language cu file with CUDA parallelism


bitonicsort.cu:
Host -> loads data from data/data.txt, sends to Device for parallel bitonic merge sort -> recieves sorted data -> prints results.
Device -> recieves unsorted data -> parallel bitonic merge sort -> returns sorted data.
